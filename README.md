# lowmem_microcontroller

<P>This library implements some useful data structures like lists, queues, and stacks for use on low memory microcontrollers.</P>

<B>Who is this library is for?</B>

<P>This library implements some useful common data structures and algorithms intended for use on low power embedded processors.  As a quick rule of thumb â€“ if you are measuring your RAM in megabytes and not kilobytes, or if you are not worried about needing to make your program fit into on chip flash memory, than this library is probably not for you.</P>


I'm starting this collection as a place for things I keep needing to write every few years. 
Most of it is vailable from C++ and the STL.
